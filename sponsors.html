        "The channel was partnered with YouTube within 9 months of true launch. 3 months later, I made the decision to found TheBeautyofMath Inc. as a tutoring business and am looking forward to the challenges ahead as I strive to deliver for all of my students the same joy I experienced in finally getting AIME qualified. Growing up I never had a single hour of private tutoring. So the YouTube Channel was honestly a way to give help to similar people who like my family could not afford such things." - TheBeautyofMath
