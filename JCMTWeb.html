    The James Clemens Math Tournament was created to help students of various skill levels compete in math. At its
    heart, the JCMT is less
    about winning, more about learning. The JCMT is a place where students can learn and grow, and grow enthusiastic
    towards math. Although we acknowledge that math is an extremely difficult subject, we encourage everyone to give
    their best effort in solving problems. In addition, in an attempt to help students learn, we have created a
    tournament that combines games and collaboration to foster the next generation of math enthusiasts. Thank you all
    for coming to the first edition of the James Clemens Math Tournament, and we hope we will see you all next year.
    In the meantime, this website can be used to learn more about the JCMT, and to view past tests and answer keys.
